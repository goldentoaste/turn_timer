# Turn Timer
For use with a turn based multiplayer game that might need a chess timer like feature. In my case,
for a MTG EDH simulator.

Currently a functional demo, with ui for 3 - 5 players. The whole system is not very secure, 
resilient, nor *that* user friendly, but good enough for casual table top games.
